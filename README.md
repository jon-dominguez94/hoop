# Hoop

## Background and Overview

Hoop is a simple but addictive game. The main focus of the game is to use your mouse to draw a hoop around friendly objects on the board while avoiding enemy objects. Hooping around the friendly objects will increase your score, multiplier, and replenish your health. Hooping around enemy objects will decrease your health and reset your multiplier.

The longer you survive, the faster objects will show up. Each object has a certain lifetime and will disappear when it expires. Friendly objects will flash before disappearing as an alert so you can give those priority. Allowing friendlies to disappear will reset your multiplier and decrease your health.

The traced mouse trail will only last a certain amount of time before fading away. Objects must be fully encompassed with an active trail to count. Hooping around multiple friendlies with the same hoop will result in a bonus.
